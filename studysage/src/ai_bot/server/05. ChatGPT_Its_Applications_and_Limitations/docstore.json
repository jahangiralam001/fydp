Overfitting is a common problem in machine\nlearning that occurs when a model is trained on a small dataset\nand starts to fit the noise in the data instead of the underlying\npattern.  This  leads  to  a  model  that  performs  well  on  the\ntraining  data  but  poorly  on  new,  unseen  data.  In  the  case  of\nChatGPT,  overfitting  can  manifest  in  several  ways.  One  way\nthat overfitting can affect ChatGPT is through the selection of\nthe training data.
