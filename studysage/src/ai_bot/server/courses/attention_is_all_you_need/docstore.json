Givenz,  the decoder then generates an output\nsequence(y\n1\n,...,y\nm\n)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n2\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully","metadata":{"id":8}}],["95dcff4c-c54e-48de-8772-31945b144d15",{"pageContent":"2\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\nrespectively.\n3.1    Encoder and Decoder Stacks\nEncoder:The encoder is composed of a stack ofN= 6identical layers.
